## Welcome!

### I was in class today and found out about react. I decided to install it, and being the first year front-end dev student that I am, I didn't even know what got me to next.js. The college I go to teaches us the basics of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. Though those are good basics, I have read a lot of blog posts on Reddit that tell me that PHP is outdated and companies are not looking for PHP devs anymore.

### I spent some time trying to figure out how to create a stack that was both productive, and that would land me a job later. So I decided to play into it and code the website you are seeing right now!

###  I have been looking at forums and docs. Trying to figure out how certain things work, heck I am still looking at the Tailwind docs. I also have no idea how I got the blogposts to work and already forgot what a "slug" is. But I have a feeling that I will learn more things over the years to come.
